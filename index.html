                    </p>

                    <ul class="amount">
                        <li>1 ½ cups</li>
                        <li>3 ½ teaspoons</li>

                        <li>1 ¼ cups / 3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                        <li>1</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul class="ingredient">
                        <li>Flour:</li>
                        <li>Baking powder:</li>
                        <li>Sugar:</li>

                        <li>This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
                        <li>Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</li>
                        <li>Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
                        <li>A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
                        <li>Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
                        <li>A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>

                    <h3>How to Make Pancakes From Scratch?</h3>
                        <p>It's not hard to make homemade pancakes — you just need a good recipe. That's where we come in! You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
                                <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
                                <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li>
                                <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
                                <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
                            </ol>
                    <h4>When to Flip Pancakes</h4>
                            <p>Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will usually take about two to three minutes on each side.</p>

                        <h3>Directions</h3>
                            <p>Begin by whisking the egg, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl. Then, add the ground beef and bread crumbs before forming the mixture into ¾-inch patties. Place the patties on a preheated grill and cook for six to eight minutes per side.

Make sure the beef's temperature reads at least 160 degrees F before serving, and you're ready to go. Top with classic condiments like mustard, ketchup, and mayo for full-fledged flavor.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. </li>
                                    <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
                                    <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
                                    <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
                                    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
